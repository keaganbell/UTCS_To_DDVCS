Assuming you have setup geant4 on ifarm:

- Copy /work/hallc/nps/vardan/G4.nps/g4.11.02/tcs_sim.shared/tcs_setup
  directory to your dedicated directory.

- mkdir tcs_setup-build

- cd tcs_setup-build

- cmake ../tcs_setup

- make -- will produce executable named tcs.

In the tcs_setup_build you will have following files and directories:

- beam_definition.txt -- defines beam particles and/or events:

  - incoming particle name;
  - low and high boundaries of momentum range;
  - X, Y, Z coordinates of volume where incoming particles are sampled;
  - the volume sizes along X, Y, Z axes;
  - beam deflection angles [deg], in YZ and XZ planes;
  - beam divegence angles [deg], in YZ and XZ planes;
  - sampling mode of incoming particles, must be tcs, beam, brem or hep_data.

- field_param.txt -- defines target's magnetic field, particularly
  relative strength (nominally 1), rotation wrt Z axis (nominally 90
  deg), name of file containing the field map;

- field -- directory where the field map file resides;

- nps_module.inp -- defines parameters of modules of calorimeters
  related to light generation in PWO crystals and optical photon
  tracking, particularly flags of Cherenkov light and scintillation
  generation;

- random_seeds.dat -- 3 numbers to initiate random generator;

- run.mac -- a macro to run the code, particularly defines number of
  events to sample;

- stacking control.txt -- for some debugging purposes, leave as it is;

- tcs_gdmls -- contains files with GDML definitions of parts of the setup;

- tcs_gen.data -- an example file of TCS events written in HEP ascii format;

- tcs_gen.kin_data -- file containing per event kinematic quantities
  of TCS events in tcs_gen.data.

Running the tcs executable without parameters will visualize the TCS
setup in OpenGL rendering.

Executing './tcs run.mac' will simulate 20k example TCS events and
output results in tcs_setup.root file.

Notes:

In the beam_definitions.txt file, when sampling mode is 'tcs', the
previous fields have no effect except the sampling volume position an
sizes. In case of hep_data mode the user has to provide HEP data in
file named hep.data.
